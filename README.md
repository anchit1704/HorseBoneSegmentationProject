# HorseBoneSegmentationProject

In this project, I develop a threshold based image segmentation algorithm to detect bone vs non bone regions in a CT scan. 

Steps - 

1. Annotate the CT images using 3D slicer tool. You can download 3D slicer from [here](https://download.slicer.org/)https://download.slicer.org/.
